                <p>I'm comfortable admitting I'm still very much in the beginner phase of my development career, and the more I learn the more I realize how much there is to learn! That being said I'm excited to see this page fill up with new ideas and concepts as time goes on. Lately I have found myself favoring more front-end web development work and plan to explore some project ideas that will give me experience in that direction(as well as game development!), however I still appreciate the logical puzzle that is back-end development. Here's a few projects that I've put together so far!</p>
                <br/>                
                <p>P.S. This site was built from scratch with base HTML, CSS, JS, and a little bit of BootStrap.

					<h2>Meter Issue Tracker</h2>
					<p>A simple demo of the Java Web Application that I'm currently building for Austin Energy. The purpose of the dashboard is to track the status of the many meters in the Austin Electric database and to aggregate and display the number of meters with each error type as well as which meters are defective. The office that brought me in to create this wanted an easier way to sort through all the data that they were looking at, as they currently use multiple apps to get the data they need. My goal is to consolidate their data into one app that will connect them to any information needed.</p>

					<h3>Starting From Scratch</h3>
					<p>When I was brought in to build this application I was given very little direction in how to begin and what technology to use, but a lot of freedom to explore my options. After a significant amount of research into what my best options were I decided learn how to use JSP pages and Java servlets as a backend with Eclipse as an IDE to connect with the company's Oracle server, as I have a strong affinity for Java. Working in a goverment office I have had to jump through hoops to get the software and database access I need to put this app together. Because of this, I decided to build a sample database from scratch using Oracle SQL Developer while I waited for access to the real data. The dumby database I made is what is being queried on the running demo, though I migrated it to MySQL for ease of use when hosting on Amazon Web Services. On the front-end I have a little bit of Javascript running and decided to learn some Bootstrap in my spare time for the UI.</p>

					<h3>From Present to Future</h3>
					<p>As you might be able to see, the application currently functions well, with an accurate count of flagged meters displayed under each error tab. When clicked a table is dynamically generated from the servlet showing which specific error cases and meters fall under the clicked hyperlink. You may see that currently the aggregate tables have significant empty space next to them and that is because I am fiddling with the idea of displaying visualizations made from Tableau in that area.<br>Moving forward I plan to implement more tracking for other error and alarm types. One other goal is to hyperlink the meter ids to route to another web application used by the company to track meter status and to load in form data for that meter.</p>
