					<h2>Meter Issue Tracker</h2>
					<p>A simple demo of the Java Web Application that I'm currently building for Austin Energy. The purpose of the dashboard is to track the status of the many meters in the Austin Electric database and to aggregate and display the number of meters with each error type as well as which meters are defective. The office that brought me in to create this wanted an easier way to sort through all the data that they were looking at, as they currently use multiple apps to get the data they need. My goal is to consolidate their data into one app that will connect them to any information needed.</p>

					<h3>Starting From Scratch</h3>
					<p>When I was brought in to build this application I was given very little direction in how to begin and what technology to use, but a lot of freedom to explore my options. After a significant amount of research into what my best options were I decided learn how to use JSP pages and Java servlets as a backend with Eclipse as an IDE to connect with the company's Oracle server, as I have a strong affinity for Java. Working in a goverment office I have had to jump through hoops to get the software and database access I need to put this app together. Because of this, I decided to build a sample database from scratch using Oracle SQL Developer while I waited for access to the real data. The dumby database I made is what is being queried on the running demo, though I migrated it to MySQL for ease of use when hosting on Amazon Web Services. On the front-end I have a little bit of Javascript running and decided to learn some Bootstrap in my spare time for the UI.</p>

				<div class = "col-md-4 project-summary">
					<h3>End Results</h3>
					<p>As you might be able to see, the application currently functions well, with an accurate count of flagged meters displayed under each error tab. When clicked a table is dynamically generated from the servlet showing which specific error cases and meters fall under the clicked hyperlink. The search bar has also been implemented to display individual specific meters along with the names of the flag tables that they exist in. <br>In the end the application functions as intended with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. In terms of future development and implementation of queries for the real AE database I have provided documentation, examples and guidelines for my employer to continue the dashboard project in the future.</p>

					<h2>Destination Study</h2>
					<p>Destination study is an Android application developed by me and 2 other students during my mobile computing course at UT. It displays a list of locations around UT campus that are known popular study spots. When clicking a location that spots page information is diplayed, including 2 ratings for noise level and occupancy. Students are able to check into the application and submit their own rating which is stored in a built in SQLite database. The technologies behind the app are of course are Java and Android Studio and we built it over a period of around 2 months.</p>

					<h3>Challenges and Collaboration</h3>
					<p>When building this application one of the biggest obstacles we faced was of course our lack of experience in mobile development. It was each of ours first time building an app and we had only a few weeks of practice with some demos to understand Android Studio. Just as well it was our first time working with a database in the form of SQLite, so this project was definitely a learn as you build experience. Another challenge to face was deciding the scope of the application. We had to make sure that our goals were reachable within the limited time period we had so simplicity was key when deciding the funcationality of the application. One other obstacle was working around each others schedule as this was something we worked on outside of class even though the class was structured around this single project for the most part. A combination of dividing tasks and communication went a long way in making the project a success.</p>
