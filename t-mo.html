                            Youth sports can be a very busy experience. <b>Coaches and parents must use multiple tools to manage all of their teams</b>, which can be overwhelming at times and causes <b>communication errors.</b> It becomes even more difficult when <b>parent involvement is low, leaving coaches to handle many responsibilities alone.</b>

                            <b>T-Mo, a central team management hub</b> that makes it simple for coaches and parents to <b>manage and track all their youth teams.</b> T-Mo will <b>improve team involvement and efficiency</b> by combining functionality that exists in tools currently at use, while making them more user-friendly and engaging.

His <b>goal</b> was to disrupt the youth sports app market with <b>an app that combined the functionality of multiple existing youth sports management and statistics apps, for any type of team.</b> It was clear to us that <b>our top priority</b> would be <b>simplifying and focusing on an MVP</b> that would differentiate us in the market.</p>

                            <p>After defining who Coach Mike is, we wanted to visualize how he regularly proceeds through a season. So, we created a <b>user journey map</b>, to ideate on <b>how things might go wrong during a season</b> with their current management methods. In the case of Mike, because he is managing information in multiple sources that are not specifically designed for team communication, it becomes overwhelming when things begin to go wrong at a game.</p>

                                As our <b>interaction and visual design lead</b>, I took charge of our design system. I helped to guide my team in the creation of their own <b>reusable components</b> while managing the organization and consistency of our <b>pattern library.</b>

                                    In designing our <b>wireframes</b>, the main goal was to design a basic walkthrough of the main functionality. There wasn’t time to build out every individual feature and detail in the app, but we wanted to make sure we had enough to <b>validate our user flows</b> through each process. As <b>interaction lead</b>, I made sure our wireframes were consistent with each other and followed our design system.

                                    <b>Branding Overview</b><br>
                                    As our <b>visual design and branding lead</b>, my overall goal for the branding was to show that while our app is about youth sports and fun, it's also efficient and usable. Because we want to encourage involvement, I named the app T-Mo, short for Team More. The name itself was inspired by a couple cartoon and video game characters. I thought it would suit our app space as a youth application. The logo was more of a trial and error situation. I made several versions, trying out different things to see what might work and ended up with the logos you see here. I tried to include the app name while keeping the logo from being too complicated.

                                <b>Colors</b><br>
                                For the colors, I wanted the app to be bright and energetic. I looked at common sports color schemes and went with blue and orange and then found good shades of each to match my aesthetic goals. I tried to keep the rest of the colors minimal and functional.

                                Montserrat and Lato are both clean fonts that I’m familiar with. They’re both very readable with nice stylings of their own. Lato especially is great for reading a lot of information.

                            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
                            <p>
                                There’s a lot of room for next steps. Many areas of the application could still use some fleshing out. The main priority I see in next steps would be more usability testing. There are so many things to do in the app that it needs quite a few more rounds of testing to make sure it’s as usable as possible. 
                                <br><br>
                                Since the app is meant to be for any type of team, it will need more templates for each sport. For the purpose of our MVP we stuck with basketball as sport to build around. However, we tried to make certain features such as scorekeeping as general as possible to help reusability and scaling of the app.
                                <br><br>
                                I would personally like to see the gamification feature fully built out. Defining how sponsors interact with the app to include their deals is very important and will push the app forward in terms of monetization. Also designing how users experience the trophy system as they complete tasks is interesting to me.

                                Overall, we were proud of our work. There was a lot to learn and put together within 3 weeks. While the app is far from perfect, I believe it's more than a solid start for our clients goals moving forward.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Challenges</b><br>
                                Easily the biggest challenge we faced was figuring out an MVP. There were so many features presented to us in the beginning that we often found ourselves talking in circles. It took us almost a week of whiteboarding to understand all of the different functions our client wanted. It was also personally challenging for me since I didn't have a clue about everything that went into managing youth sports. I was able to overcome the battle against time by making quick decisions towards the end of the process. After a certain point, I decided it was time to think less and do more.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>What I Learned</b><br>
                                For one, I learned that youth sports is a logistical nightmare. This project was helpful though in terms working with a client with a lot of ideas. I had to learn that you have to say no to many things from the client side and that it's okay. I was able to successfully balance what the client wanted with what was possible for my team
