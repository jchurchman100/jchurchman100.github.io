                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Blanton Museum of Art currently has no option for selling items from its gift shop online. This can be inconvenient for customers who would like to purchase items remotely and likely limits the revenue coming into the museum.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "col-sm-4">
                        <h3>The Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Blanton needs a simple and efficient website for customers to browse and buy from their gift shop. With this option in place, more people will buy from the gift shop, increasing revenue. 
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "col-sm-4">
                        <h3>My Role</h3>
                        <p>
                            This was an indepent project, so I handled every aspect of the design process. I was provided with information about a user persona, and from there I conducted a competitive analysis, ideated on user flows, sketched and wireframed potential screens, created a prototype, ran usability tests,  and put together some mockups after iterating.

                                    I started off my process by looking into currently existing websites to perform a comparative / competitive analysis. There were 2 categories of websites that I looked at to gather the information I needed. The first category was gift shop e-commerce sites for other museums as well as similar retailers like souvenir shops. Second, I analyzed some mainstream e-commerce sites like Amazon.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Gift / Souvenir E-Commerce</h4>
                            <p>
                                    I looked at other museums that currently had online gift shops set up. This helped me to see some of the standards for how museums were categorizing their products as well as the layout for their navigations. My sitemap was mostly based on these websites.

                                    Looking at some mainstream e-commerce sites helped me to see the optimal ways to lay out my pages. I used my analysis of these sites to design a lot of the components that I used in many areas of the site. This category also helped me to figure out efficient task flows for multiple areas of my site such as the check out process and rewards points.

                                        After looking at some of the different websites out there, I went ahead and started sketching out some of their pages. This helped me to internalize what the basic elements of my website might look like.

                                        Once I had sketched through some of the websites, I put together a feature analysis chart to really see the standard practices in e-commerce sites. I stuck with the museum shops and target for the analysis, as I wanted to follow most of what other gift shops were doing and compare that to a single mainstream site.

                                    After defining who would be using the site, I needed to figure out how the site would be laid out before I could start seeing how they move through it. So I made a simple site map based on what a general e-commerce website might look like.

                                    Following conventions was my goal for a lot of my design. In my early sketches I tried to combine a lot of ideas I had seen in my comparative analysis. My goal was to make my site familiar and simple, while hitting the other goals outlined by my user persona. I drafted out a few different options for how I could do this and fused these drafts when going into the wireframes later.

However, a couple issues came up in finding the contact information for one user, and there was some confusion on the rewards points system shown in the checkout process.</p>

Because of the time limit I mainly focused on usability and simplicity, while leaving room for visual modifications later. I would also work towards a mobile version of the site of course, since that's an obvious way to get even more people looking at the store.</p>

                                    <b>Overview</b><br>
                                    This project went by really quickly. It was definitely a lesson in time-boxing and focusing on the MVP. In the end I'm pretty happy with the final product and was able to present something I was proud of.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Challenges</b><br>
                                    Time! I fell behind really fast in this one and had to spend a lot of late nights catching back up. Fortunately I got so focused in my wireframing sessions that I ended up actually getting really far ahead towards the end of the week. Also, during the scope of the project I was just using Figma for the first time, and wasn't familiar with the component system. This made going back into the project to create high fidelity mockups pretty tedious. I'm glad I managed to pick up the habit of using reusable components at this point.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>What I Learned</b><br>
                                    Since this was my first time using Figma and wireframing as part of the real UX process I learned a lot about wireframing techniques and putting together layouts. This was also my first time putting together a user persona, a site map and user flows. These were all very helpful for guiding my direction in the project.
